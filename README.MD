<h1>Native Obfuscator GUI</h1>
<p>This uses radioegor146's native obfuscator (https://github.com/radioegor146), but everything is automated by this little thing</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>First, you need to install java. You can download it here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html#license-lightbox</p>

<p>Next, you need to install cmake, you can download that here: https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.25.1/cmake-3.25.1-windows-x86_64.msi
You need to make sure that you allow it to install on all or just this current user (the only reason not to put it on all users is if you're using a public or famiily computer)</p

<p>Finally, run the setup.bat file and then run the python file</p>
